      <h2>King Oliver- Doctor Jazz</h2>
      <p>
        King Oliver (1881-1938) was a famous New Orleans based cornet player and jazz musician, producing popular songs such as “Dippermouth Blues, “Sweet Like This”, and “Doctor Jazz”. Featured above is “Doctor Jazz”, which has a big focus on the
        band member’s solos. In the beginning of the song, there are plenty of breaks. Next, at around the 0:33 mark, there is a piano solo. Next, around 0:53, everyone plays their bits, which is then followed by a trumpet/cornet solo at 0:57.
        Following that, there is a clarinet solo, then either trombone or some sort of French horn solo (I am unsure what instrument this is), then a bass clarinet solo, and finished with everyone playing again. At 2:10 and 2:15, everyone breaks
        again for the trumpet/cornet to play. Finally, the song is finished with collective improvisation with a few breaks scattered in.

      <h2>Shannon Powell at the Ascona Jazz Festival, 2013</h2>
      <p>
        Shannon Powell is an internationally renown jazz and ragtime drummer. Born and raised in New Orleans’ Tremé neighborhood, Powell has been surrounded by music and jazz culture his entire life. Today, he performs all over the world. He
        currently plays with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band and leads his own quartet. The video above features Powell (drums), Roderick Paulin (saxophone), Kyle Roussel (piano), and Roland Guerin (bass) performing for the Ascona Jazz Festival in
        Switzerland. At the 1:17 mark, the group has a pre-arranged ensemble passage, in which the saxophone and singer (Powell) play back and forth, while the rest of the band provides supporting rhythms and harmony. At the 2:00 mark, the band
        breaks out into collective improvisation.
