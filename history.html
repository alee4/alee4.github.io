      <h2>Traditional Jazz- An Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Traditional Jazz is one of New Orleans’ oldest, most historically rich musical styles and has played a central role in New Orleans’ development both socially and culturally. Originating in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the
        Traditional Jazz style combined early brass-band march styles, French quadrilles (a style of dance/music similar to square dancing, but more fancy), beguine (a type of French ballroom dance/music), ragtime, blues, and improvisation. There are
        two main theories on how this timeless style emerged. The first being the sociological “uptown/downtown” theory and the second being the developmental “generational” theory. Note that these two theories are not necessarily mutually exclusive,
        and actually compliment each other very well.

      <h2>The sociological "Uptown/Downtown" Theory</h2>
      <p>
        The sociological “uptown/downtown” theory is essentially that due to the Jim Crow laws imposed on New Orleans’ Creole of Color and African American populations, the forced intermingling of cultures allowed for Traditional Jazz to evolve. In a
        time fraught with blatant racism and segregation, the Jim Crow laws emerged to further perpetuate these injustices. In simple terms, the Jim Crow Laws were a bunch of state and local laws that legalized the segregation of people of color. For
        a place as ethnically diverse and multicultural as New Orleans, the Jim Crow laws proved to be a major social rift in the city. African Americans, who were already considered second class citizens (even after the abolishment of slavery), lost
        even more rights. The Creole of Color population, who were previously considered of the “white” class, effectively lost many of their rights overnight. For the Creole musicians in New Orleans, this meant a sudden loss of jobs and performance
        options, which led to many of them joined already established African American bands. And due to the mixing of these two musical cultures in the bands, Traditional Jazz music and themes were able to grow.

      <h2>The Developmental "Generational" Theory</h2>
      <p>
        The developmental “generational” theory simply states that younger audiences within New Orleans’ “party hard” culture caused Traditional Jazz style music to rise in popularity. It goes without saying that New Orleans has a live fast, party
        hard culture. In a city where music is everywhere and hedonistic attitudes are a big part of culture, there is a constant need for new and innovative styles of music. Traditional Jazz style fits this bill perfectly. The combination of
        generally up-tempo, happy, and unpredictable nature of jazz made it the perfect style of music for the excitable younger generations of New Orleans. Traditional Jazz styles were able to surpass the popularity of more formal styles of music
        and dance, cementing itself as one of the premier musical styles of New Orleans.
