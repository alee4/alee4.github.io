      <h2>Instruments in Traditional Jazz</h2>
      <p>
        Generally, Traditional Jazz instruments were pretty uniform across different songs and bands. There are two main groups of Traditional Jazz instruments, the “front line” section and “rhythm” section. Front line instruments consisted of the
        cornet/trumpet, the clarinet, and the trombone. These instruments frequently engaged in improvisation during songs. The rhythm instruments consisted of the bass, tuba, banjo/guitar, piano, and drums. The rhythm section kept a highly
        syncopated beat, usually in 4/4 time. As Traditional Jazz evolved, the instrument the music primarily focused on changed as well. In the early 1900s, the violin led most music, however with the need for more sound and loudness, the cornet
        eventually rose in popularity. By 1917, the cornet was surpassed by the trumpet in terms of popularity.

      <h2>Important Musical Elements</h2>
      <p>
        Improvisation is one of the defining traits of not just Traditional Jazz, but jazz as a whole. Improvisation refers to making up the music in the middle of the song. This is what makes Traditional Jazz music so unpredictable and is one of the
        main themes of the jazz genre. Improvisation parts can either be done as a group or as a solo. While improvisation is arguably one of the most important parts of Traditional Jazz, there are many other factors that give the style its unique
        sound. Among those factors are pre-arranged unison ensemble passages, which refer to when many instruments play the same part. This is almost the opposite of improvisation. Next, breaks happen when all the instruments stop in unison. During
        this time, one musician plays a (possibly improvised) solo to fill the hole. In addition, there is also stop-time, which refers to when the back up band accents behind a soloist. Finally, there is syncopation, which is when the rhythm is
        played on the off beat of the music. Although there are many more interesting musical elements in Traditional Jazz, these are a few of the most prominent.
